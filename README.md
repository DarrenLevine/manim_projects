# Manim Projects

Dockerfile and vscode configured workspace for creating manim animations.

## Getting Started

1) Install docker/vscode prerequisites: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_installation)
2) Clone this repo.
3) Use the "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container" command from the vscode Command Palette.
4) Wait for the dockerfile to build the docker image, this may take awhile (15-45 minutes).
5) Open an animation file to work on, for example: [simple_example.py](simple_example.py).
6) Run the "Manim: Runs a Sideview" command from the vscode Command Palette.
7) From then on, re-saving the file will cause the manim animation in the sideview to update automatically.
